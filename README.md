# Wunderspark
An algorithm which utilizes web-scraping, Pandas, and Seaborn to process and display historic temperature and dewpoint data from Wunderground's Personal Weather Stations (PWS) across the world, for any given month of the year*.
*Note that if the PWS does not contain datasets for a given month or year, the program will yield an empty graph.
